;The protocol for J1708 communication requires a packet that is no more
;than 21 characters long.  The first character of a packet is the MID
;or Message Identification Character.  The last character is the checksum
;which is simply the two's complement of the 8 bit sum of the MID and all
;the data characters.  All characters in the packet added together give 0.

;Our structure adds the following detail to all packets directed to a sign:
;
; Character 1	MID
; Character 2	Always 7F hex
; Character 3	Number of characters in packet including MID and checksum.
;		This will always be 8-21 except in the case of a special
;		transmission which resets the sign or queries the sign to
;		send its status, in which case the character count is 7.
; Character 4   Transmission ID# 0-41 hex groups associated packets together
;		so that they can be assembled into one message.  The
;		transmission ID# is a normally a six bit dummy value 0-3F hex
;		that should count up by one every time a new transmission is
;		sent.  Exceptions are transmission ID# 40 hex which is
;		reserved to query the sign to send its status, and 41 hex
;		which is reserved to reset the sign in preparation to receive
;		a new message immediately, even if it is still busy.  The
;		reset function requires a brief interval to prepare the sign
;		to resume operations, so a short delay on the order of 100
;		msec is recommended before attempting to send further
;		messages to the sign.
; Character 5	Total number of packets N, 1-6 in this transmission is
;		encoded in the high 4 bits 7654.
; 		Packet position in transmission of this packet, 0 to <N-1>
;		is encoded in the low 4 bits 3210.
; Data		1-14 characters for normal transmissions, but absent in
;		the case of special Transmission ID# 40 hex which is
;		a query for the sign to send its status, or 41 hex which
;		forces an immediate reset.
; Zero byte	Always 00 hex
; Checksum	Two's complement of the sum of all preceding characters.

;The MID to be carried by messages for the sign must match the DIP switch
;setting on the back of the sign.  Note that SAE J1708 specifically reserves
;many ID numbers for certain classes of devices and compliance categories.
;Responses sent by the sign will carry the MID which is the same as the
;one set by the DIP switches except that the LSB is reversed.  If the DIP
;switch is confined to even values, then the sign will respond with an MID
;which is one higher than the DIP switch setting.  DIP switch 1, on the
;right end, is the least significant bit.  An open switch is a logic one.
;Use of DIP switch settings 0, 1, 7E hex, and 7F hex is not recommended.

;Packets may be sent redundantly if desired.  Once all packets of a specific
;transmission number have been received, their data characters are spliced
;together to form the body of the message which is then acted upon.  If
;redundant transmission is used, the transmission number must remain
;constant while all packets are sent.  If the data carried by a transmission
;requires multiple packets to carry it, then all the packets except the
;last one must carry the maximum allowable 14 bytes of data.

;The data body of a transmission can include any of the following commands.
;It should contain only printable characters and spaces, with the exception
;of the codes from 80-FF hex that are used by the ~G graphics encoding
;sequence described farther down.  Each command starts with a caret (5E hex)
;followed by an operation code letter.  A typical command series will
;bring some text in, wait briefly, then take it out.  Loops can be setup
;to flash or flip-flop screens.  When the command sequence is through being
;interpreted, the LED screen will retain its final condition indefinitely,
;so you must program the message exits into the command list, or else plan
;to perform them in a separate transmission after a short time.
;
;	^IItext		Shows "text" immediately.
;	^IAtext		Shows "text" coming in from above
;	^IBtext		Shows "text" coming in from below
;
;			The ^I commands automatically center the "text"
;			messages on screen.  If a message is too long to
;			fit on the screen, the command will be converted
;			automatically to an S type stream command.
;			These commands can be used as "Out"
;			functions by specifying no text or text
;			containing only blanks.
;
;	^Stext		Streams "text" right to left and off screen once.
;			No action occurs if "text" is null.
;
;	All commands which display text will accept the following special
;	embedded sequences that begin with a tilde (7E hex):
;
;	  ~B	Switch to bold font for subsequent text characters
;	  ~b	Same as ~B but uses three blank columns between characters
;	  ~C	Switch to compact font for subsequent text characters
;	  ~c	Same as ~C but uses two blank columns between characters
;	  ~D	Switch to default 5x7 font for subsequent text characters
;	  ~d	Same as ~D but uses two blank columns between characters
;	  ~Gx..	Graphic patterns for successive columns of LEDs are carried
;		by a series of characters x, each of which carries a 7 bit
;		column pattern in bits 6543210 with bit 0 being topmost,
;		and a 1 in bit 7.  The graphic mode terminates and text
;		mode resumes upon the first character with bit 7 clear.
;		Note that text characters always bear one (2 for bold font)
;		blank column on the right but none on the left.  If an
;		embedded graphic is followed by more text, you should
;		encode an empty column at the end of the graphic so that
;		it doesn't touch the following text.
;
;	^Ln	Loop through subsequent code up to ^E for n repetitions.
;		The rep count n can be one or two ASCII decimal digits
;		expressing values from 1-99.
;
;	^E	End of loop.  Sends interpreter back to previous ^L
;		to repeat commands until rep count is complete.  Nesting
;		of loop structures is not supported.
;
;	^F	End of loop forever.  Sends interpreter back to previous
;		^L in infinite loop regardless of specified ^L loop count.
;		In this case, a reset transmission with ID 41 hex is required
;		to stop the running program and prepare to receive another
;		program.
;
;	^Pn	Sets Pace of display refresh and motion.  The parameter n
;		is one or two ASCII decimal digits expressing a range 1-20.
;		The default after reset is Pace 4.
;
;	^=n	Sets the number of LED refresh scans performed between
;		image shifts during horizontal motions like streaming.
;		The parameter n is a single decimal ASCII digit 1-6.  The
;		default after reset is 1 which results in a very sharp
;		and crisp looking image on the LEDs.  It also will produce
;		a perceptible flicker at very low ^P pace settings.  At
;		the default ^=1 setting with the very sharp image it is
;		impossible to achieve a very slow shifting speed without
;		flicker.  Values of the ^= parameter greater than 1 will
;		perform multiple display scans for each shift.  This will
;		allow a high ^P pace to be chosen for low flicker, while
;		holding down the speed of travel for streaming.  There is
;		a side effect though, which is that the letters no longer
;		look as crisp as they do with the ^=1 setting.  Optimum
;		appearance of the sign on video will result from using
;		^P19 in combination with an ^=4.  This will refresh at
;		at 120 frames/second and shift at 30 columns/second.
;		This will minimize beating artifacts against the video
;		camera's 60 frame per second rate.
;
;		The table below illustrates the interaction between the
;		^P and ^= settings.  The =1 column is the refresh frame
;		rate regardless of the ^= setting.  It affects the amount
;		of perceived flicker.  The values in the =n columns show
;		the rates of travel that result from various ^= settings
;		at the given ^P pace setting.

;
;	^R	Return to beginning of memory.  If this instruction is
;		placed at the end of the program, the entire program
;		will repeat forever.  In this case, a reset transmission
;		with ID 41 hex is required to stop the running program and
;		prepare to receive another program.
;
;	^Wn	Waits n tenths of a second.  The delay interval can be
;		one or two ASCII decimal digits expressing delays from
;		0.1 to 9.9 seconds.  Longer delays can be had by using
;		multiple ^W commands or by putting an ^W command in a
;		loop.
;
;	^XS	Drives the Sink transistor connected to the AUX terminal
;		so that the output is pulled to ground.  This can be used
;		to activate a chime or LED flasher that will help to
;		alert people.  The output is a TIP120 darlington without
;		a heatsink.  Device dissipation should not exceed one watt.
;		This will allow a continuous current of one ampere if
;		the load will allow the transistor to pull the AUX pin
;		all the way down to its saturation voltage.  The AUX output
;		is pulled up to +5 with a 10K ohm resistor.  It may be
;		pulled up higher to the vehicle battery voltage of 30
;		volts or less with no harm.  The state of the AUX pin
;		is reported by the special query transmission report.
;		This allows the sink transistor, and possibly its load
;		to be tested.  It also allows the AUX terminal to be
;		used as a generic digital input line.
;
;	^XF	Causes the sink transistor connected to the AUX terminal
;		to turn off, allowing the AUX terminal to Float up to
;		+5 or higher if a load is connected to the vehicle battery
;		voltage.  This is the default state after reset.
;
;	^XDn	Adjust autodimming threshold to value n which is a 1-3
;		digit decimal ASCII number from 1-255.  The default value
;		is 16.  This value is not affected by a reset command.
;
;	^XBn	Force brightness level n in range 0-31.  Values 2-31 are
;		accepted as actual brightness levels to be forced.  Values
;		above 31 are converted to 31.  Values 0 and 1 are accepted
;		as commands to disable forced brightness level mode and
;		to return to normal sensor based brightness level mode.
;		This mode is not affected by a reset command.
;
;	^Yn	Displays test pattern n.  The pattern number n can be
;		one or two decimal ASCII digits specifying a value 0-17.
;
;		 0	blank
;		 1	row 1 lit
;		 2	row 2 lit
;		 3	row 3 lit
;		 4	row 4 lit
;		 5	row 5 lit
;		 6	row 6 lit
;		 7	row 7 lit
;		 8	columns 1,5,9... lit
;		 9	columns 2,6,10... lit
;		10	columns	3,7,11... lit
;		11	columns 4,8,12... lit
;		12	left half lit
;		13	right half lit
;		14	checkerboard 1
;		15	checkerboard 2
;		16	current brightness level 2-31
;		17	all lit

;
;
;The special transmission ID# 40 hex queries the sign for its status.  The
;sign will reply with a message that indicates its current condition.
;
;Character 1	MID = DIP switch MID XOR 1
;Character 2	Always 7F hex
;Character 3	Always 8
;Character 4	Transmission ID# of the last transmission which was received
;		successfully in its entirety, excepting query ID 40 hex.
;Character 5	R or B for Ready or Busy.  When a transmission is received
;		which tells the sign to do some display work, the sign
;		will become Busy until that command list is completed.  You
;		must not attempt to send another transmission to the sign
;		when it is Busy.  It does not have enough memory to be able
;		to accept another transmission until it is done executing
;		the prior commands and can free up the memory that they
;		occupied.  In order to implement reliable flow control,
;		you must either query the sign to verify that it is Ready,
;		or else implement conservative minimum delays externally
;		that will be sufficient to assure that the sign has
;		finished its work before giving it more commands.
;Character 6	S or F for Sink or Float as regards the voltage on the
;		AUX terminal of the sign.  This is an HCT type CMOS
;		input protected with a 47K ohm resistor and a 4.3 volt
;		zener diode.  Logic 0 (S) is guaranteed at voltages less
;		than 0.8 volts.  Logic 1 (F) is guaranteed at voltages
;		greater than 2.0 volts.
;Character 7	Always 00H
;Checksum	Two's complement of the sum of all preceding characters.
